## Sample Final Project Ideas

The final project should be a capstone experience, allowing your to synthesize the skills, tools, and concepts you’ve learned over the semester.  Ideally, the project will incorporate some of the knowledge you brought to class and lead in a direction that links up with other SILS courses or your intended career.  To give you a sense of the scope I’m anticipating for the final projects, here is a list of some that you might select:

* Build and package a Python program 

* Find and substantially modify an existing Python program (e.g. a Pygame game)

* Build and deploy a set of Bash or Python scripts to automate a workflow (e.g. PDF slicer/recombiner)

* Make a custom Emacs or Vim setup (with, e.g. multiplexing, keybindings, plugins, etc)

* Build and deploy a Linux web server and basic HTML site 

* Build and deploy a Raspberry Pi-based internet connected device (e.g. Twitter printer)

* Build, customize and deploy a Jekyll-based blog to Github or your own server

Note that we won’t cover all of these topics in class, but we will learn how to learn new technologies, so motivated students should have no problem implementing projects like these using open resources and my help.  Each project should utilize appropriate open source code or programs.  In every case, the finished project source should be available on Github.com and be fully documented so that others (and most importantly your instructor) can see how and why you built them.  Ideally, they’d also include a roadmap for future changes and indications of how others might get involved.

Projects that are less technically accomplished should include additional research into the history of their open source components and an account of the community that surrounds them.  Finally, give an account of the developer tools such as text editors, version control, and communication methods you used, along with why you chose that particular workflow, how it worked, and how you might alter it in the future.

Full details will be distributed later in the semester.

## Readings

### Texts

Many readings will be drawn from Think Python, which is available for free at [http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) and can be purchased in print on Amazon.  We won’t cover the entire text, but it is an excellent source for those who plan to go deeper with Python beyond the course.  Other open texts include Learn Python the Hard Way and Pro Git.

Lectures on software-carpentry.org will be assigned to give background before some class sessions and exercises.  These lectures can be watched via video or read via the transcript and slides available on the page.  (For an example, see [http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/shell/intro.html](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/shell/intro.html))

The incomplete but generally excellent Hitchiker’s guide to Python ([http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)) contains many real-world things like code styling, commenting, and documentation convetions.  Several readings are drawn from it.
